Lead DevSecOps Engineer building secure, automated cloud platforms - specialising in Microsoft Azure ☁️🔐  

I solve modern infrastructure problems without creating new ones.

By day, I work across cloud security, automation, and platform engineering in regulated enterprise environments. Outside of that, I’m usually experimenting with MLOps, breaking and rebuilding Terraform modules, or learning more Go (with occasional detours into C#).

You’ll usually find me working on:

- Terraform & Infrastructure as Code (occasionally overengineered, always improved)
- Kubernetes, Docker & container platforms
- Microsoft Defender & Cloud Security Engineering
- Python, Go & PowerShell automation
- Highly available platform architecture
- Azure (specialist) & AWS (experienced)
- Databricks & data platform engineering
- Agile delivery & DevOps culture
- Blaming DNS (correctly, most of the time)
- Drinking either too much or not enough coffee

Azure is my primary domain, where I design secure, scalable environments at enterprise scale. I take particular interest in security-first platform design, governance automation, and building reusable infrastructure patterns, but I'm always learning more and dipping into multi-cloud environments and hybrid setups.

Good engineering principles travel well -whether that’s across clouds, data platforms, or languages I’m currently trying to master.

## Libre DevOps

[Libre DevOps](https://libredevops.org) is my technical portfolio and experimentation space.

It’s where I publish reusable modules, patterns, and ideas that deserve to live beyond a single project. Some things are polished. Some are explorations. All of it is practical.

Interested in collaborating 🌈?

Check out Libre DevOps and [get in touch](mailto:craig@craigthacker.dev).
