I'm a DevOps Engineer and enjoy providing modern solutions to age-old IT problems. I am currently working as a Azure Cloud Engineer for [Keoghs](https://keoghs.co.uk/) in the Platform Engineering team there. I am always working in the usual topics DevOps folk are, such as:

- Terraform
- Docker/Kubernetes
- Blaming DNS for a variety of problems
- Python Development
- Agile & Scrum Methodology
- Drinking too much or too little coffee
- Cloud Services
- Complaining in general, normally about JavaScript frameworks
- Highly available Solution Architecture
- Cyber Security

I spend most of my time at work in an Azure environment and take particular interest environments within Microsoft Azure, if you are interested in collaborating or want to get in contact with me, use the email link provided on this site, or contact me via Keybase for secure end-to-end encrypted messages.


## Azure DevOps

Being interested in Azure, I deploy some of my stuff on Azure DevOps, I have a public instance [here](https://dev.azure.com/craigthackerx/craigthackerx-azdo) - if you are interested in reading some of my spaghetti code.

I sometimes make memes to find some humour in my work. Check out the [Memes](https://craigthacker.dev/memes) page for some of my musings.
