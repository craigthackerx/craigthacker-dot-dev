I'm a DevOps Engineer and enjoy providing modern solutions to age old IT problems. I am currently working as a Principal Engineer for [NHS National Services Scotland](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/) and spend a lot of my time in the usual topics DevOps guys are interested in:

- Terraform
- Docker/Kubernetes
- Python Development
- Agile & Scrum Methodology
- Cloud Services

I spend most of my time at work in an Azure environment and take particular interest in it, if you are interested in collaborating or want to get in contact with me, use the email link provided on this site.


## Azure DevOps

Being interested in Azure, I deploy some of my stuff on Azure DevOps, I have a public instance [here](https://dev.azure.com/craigtho/craigtho-azdo) - if you are interested in reading some spaghetti code
