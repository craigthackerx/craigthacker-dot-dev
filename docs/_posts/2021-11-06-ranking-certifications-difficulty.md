## Foreword on Certifications as a whole

I have managed to clear my way through quite a few certifications in the last year, and I often get asked about what my study material is, how hard it was, how many hours it took me etc.  I have had great opportunities to develop myself as a professional at my role in the [NSS](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/), whom provide me access to several avenues of study materials and the ability to book my own exams via Microsoft.

Certifications are great for solidify some skills and validate yourself to a criteria _for someone else to see_.  Personally, I don't think certifications provide any real value as to how "good" someone is at a task.  I am not sure if that's a controversial opinion or not, but often, others can judge certs to mean that someone has acquired some deeper insight into a topic over those who don't have the same certification.

That is rubbish.  I have met professionals in my career who have no professional qualifications, no bachelors, no masters - and I could only dream of being as wise as they are in some of the subjects we share interests in.

That being said:

And going out your way to learn something new will always help benefit the reader of other things that they may have unknown.  If you stick to what you know all the time and refuse to learn, then you will likely get into a rut where "this is how we do things as this is what works" and never think "But could this be better?".  After all, if I you do 10 hours of self-study outside of work a week versus someone who doesn't, how long is it going to be before the person who doesn't find themselves behind in the tech world?

I think certification exams fall into this category as well.  You are forced to meet a criteria of a third party.  Whether that is just a sales pitch in exam form or not I don't know, but one thing is for certain - at some point, if someone truly engaged and tried to learn, someone who has a certification which meant they knew something to pass the exam at that time - how they choose to relay it and apply it is secondary.  

That's why I think certifications are "for other people" as the certification itself is not the reward to the learner - your reward is you got to pick up something new and follow a structure course along to do so.  The shiny badge at the end of it tells external people "This guy had to meet these learning objectives to pass this exam, so he probably knows _XZY_"

I should also clarify, it is not the awarding bodies job of any type of education to be all-inclusive, please see my above quote.  It is the courses job to have you think about improvements and your own circumstances, it won't instantly give you insights on the proper way to setup an Azure environment, or some unfound knowledge on setting up a Firewall just because you read up on some objectives.

This post is to detail what certs I actively have and judge difficulty for **me** to learn them.  Me and whoever is reading this (assuming you haven't already fallen asleep) are completely different learners, so what I found hard and what you find hard won't always match up.  As always, happy for anyone to connect with me to discuss if they are looking for pointers


## Scoring

For this, I am going to score the exams in an "out of 10" factor, where 0 is "very very easy, little to no study at all" and 10 is "very very hard, it took me a long time to prepare"

### AZ-900 - Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals - 1/10

This exam is a fundamentals course, so of course it is meant to be easy.  It requires a little study on Azure for you to pass, but around 1 or 2 months real world experience will likely be more than enough to get to grips.

### HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate - 5/10

Not easy, not hard, somewhere in the middle.  This being a vendor exam, then you need to know very specific things about the product as well as general programming knowledge, and how they are implemented in the Terraform DSL.
